## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### INTRODUCTION

This website was conceived as a project for the  Digital Investigation module (2019 - 2020) in the MSc. Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University.

Its aim is to put into context to what extent and how the EU is meeting its climate targets. We'll be taking a closer look at emission targets, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions and what climate neutrality (and the transition towards it), projected by 2050, might look like.  


## METHODOLOGY, DATA AND SOURCES
This project was conceived both as a journalistic and software project and therefore combines a broad range of methods, ranging from data and emissions analysis to taking interviews and studying academic papers. 

All data sources used for charts and photo credits are linked within our project, but below we have consolidated all our sources, including those that aided our research and inspired the presentation of the final piece:
