# BEHIND THE NUMBERS: WHY THE EU LOOKS LIKE IT'S MEETING ITS CLIMATE TARGETS

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### INTRODUCTION

This website was conceived as a project for the  Digital Investigation module (2019 - 2020) in the MSc. Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University.

It's aim is to put into context to what extent and how the EU is meeting its climate targets. We'll be taking a closer look at emission targets, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions and what climate neutrality (and the transition towards it), projected by 2050, might look like.  


## METHODOLOGY, DATA AND SOURCES

<!--Do we need to add our data sources (Global carbon project, EU sites, University of Leeds data, ... ? -->

This project was conceived both as a journalistic- and software project and therefore combines a broad range of methods, ranging from data and emissions analysis to taking interviews and studying academic papers.
