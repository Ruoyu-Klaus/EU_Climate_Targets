                    Climate change has been around for a while. Scientists argued as early as the end of the 19th
                    century that human emissions of greenhouse gases could alter the climate. The UN’s <a
                        href="https://www.ipcc.ch/"> Intergovernmental
                        Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a> has existed for over three decades and countless treaties -
                    from Kyoto in 2005
                    to Paris in 2016 - have been debated, ratified to national law and converted into practical
                    policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But only in the last couple of years has the issue been thrust into the mainstream, most recently by
                    Greta Thunberg and her school climate strike that called for more meaningful action and inspired a
                    generation of young activists.
                </p>
                <p>A lot of what we read about climate change is all doom and gloom, but is there an upside? Has there
                    been any real progress? We look into climate targets in the EU; explaining what progress has been
                    made, what is hidden from emissions statistics, and where we might be headed in the future.</p>

                        <p>Europe has long been making law to protect the environment, with the earliest measures dating
                            back to 1996, when the EU defined its first target: to limit the global temperature
                            rise on the planet to 2 °C, compared to where temperatures were in the nineteenth-century.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>By the end of this year, the EU was aiming to have cut its emissions of greenhouse gases by
                            20%
                            (compared to 1990).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>But it hit this target ahead of schedule, in 2017, when emissions were
                            already down by almost a quarter.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>By 2030, the EU expects to have cut them by at least 40%.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>In November 2019 a new European Commission, the EU’s cabinet of ministers, took office.
                            Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission’s first-ever female president, vowed for a green,
                            geopolitical and digital EU in her speech before Parliament.

                                ‘Green Deal’</a>
                            now aims for at least a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by
                            2030, up from its previous target of 40%.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p> It also wants Europe to become climate neutral by 2050. Climate neutrality means emissions
                            will yield no net impact on the climate: climate-damaging greenhouse gases are either
                            completely avoided, or they are offset with climate protection measures (by planting trees
                            for example).

                            <br><br>The Green Deal and its associated targets are to be debated this summer and, if

                                <p>As negotiations on the UK’s future relationship with the EU are currently taking
                                    place, with the transition period set to close by the end of this year, uncertainty
                                    remains as to how EU and UK climate expectations will relate to one another.</p>

                                <p>George Eustice, the UK’s Environment Secretary, echoed the Conservative’s campaign
                                    slogan to “Take back control”, when he said that the government would “choose
                                    autonomy over regulatory alignment, we won’t be in the single market, we won’t be in
                                    the customs union”. With Prime Minister Johnson promising “full legal autonomy” for
                                    the UK after Brexit, it seems unlikely that the UK will subject itself to
                                    supervision by the EU climate bodies, with the reprimands and fines that go with it.
                                </p>
                                <p>Greener UK, a coalition of environmental organisations, is worried however about the
                                    vacuum that may be created as the UK leaves the EU when there will be no more
                                    systems for checking that the UK is actually enforcing its environmental laws.</p>

                                <p>In March 2018, then Environment Secretary Michael Gove talked of a ‘Green Brexit’,
                                    raising visions of the UK as a global champion in green policies. With most of the
                                    UK’s environmental regulation previously covered by EU law, the UK government will
                                    have to fill the gaps left by its departure from the continental bloc. </p>

                                <p>Climate activists also fear that Brexit and the pressing discussions around trade
                                    might put the UK in a vulnerable position when it comes to agreeing on trade deals
                                    with countries that have less stringent regulations than the UK’s. They fear the
                                    need for deals will push the climate crisis off the political agenda and stop the UK
                                    from taking action.</p>

                                <p>Confronted with this criticism, government officials point to domestic emission
                                    regulations which the UK adopted in addition to adopting the EU’s policies. The UK’s
                                    Climate Change Act of 2008, for example, aims to ensure that in 2050 the UK is
                                    emitting at least 80% less greenhouse gas compared to 1990, either through
                                    eliminating the emissions or compensating for them.</p>

                                <p>Much hangs on how closely the UK remains aligned to Europe. To what extent will the
                                    two collaborate on environmental and climate issues? Will the UK remain a member of
                                    the EU Emissions Trading System, the oldest and largest emissions trading scheme? Or
                                    will it present new instruments of carbon pricing, a mechanism consisting of a cost
                                    applied to carbon pollution to encourage polluters to reduce amount of greenhouse
                                    gases they emit, in the fight against climate change? </p>

                                <p>On the international scene, within the United Nations Framework on Climate Change
                                    most notably, the UK will have to establish its own position once it is no longer
                                    part of the EU, which acts as a single entity within this framework, and will lose
                                    the power that goes with its membership. It will have to ratify agreements (such as
                                    the Paris Agreement) on its own and produce its own national climate plans, for
                                    which time and resources are scarce.

                    <p>The chart below shows which
                        countries are net consumers and which are net producers according to their emissions. EU
                        countries look particularly heavy on consumption. This sheds a different light
                        on
                        the
                        emissions savings the EU has achieved so far. Although we cannot definitively say whether
                        the
                        EU
                        would have met its 2020 emissions target if it accounted for its import-heavy status,
                        there is no doubt that meeting it
                        would have been harder.</p>

                    <p>The deteriorating state of the environment has attracted increasing attention around the world.
                        Initiatives like civic advocacy group, Extinction Rebellion, are trying to install a sense of
                        urgency (insisting we refer to a ‘climate crisis’ instead of ‘climate change’). ‘Woke’ or
                        ‘enlightened’ consumers and conscious investors are pressuring companies to adopt more
                        sustainable
                        business models, as young people around the world are taking to the streets under Greta
                        Thurnberg’s
                        lead, pushing for more ambitious climate policies from governments.
                    </p>
                    <p>The transition to climate neutrality will be gradual, but the call to action is urgent. The
                        debate
                        over who will drive this transition frequently comes down to the relative importance of
                        individuals,
                        businesses, and governments. Each of these represent different perspectives on how we can
                        achieve
                        climate neutrality in the long run. In simple terms, they respectively stand for solutions based
                        on
                        <b>lifestyle</b> (changing food consumption or choices of transport), <b>innovation</b>
                        (inventing,
                        researching or
                        designing our way out of the problem) and <b>regulation</b> (with governments intervening
                        through
                        legislation). Rather than being independent, these categories are interdependent. Working within
                        a ‘cyclical
                        diagram’, each node’s activity is part of a larger recurring process towards climate neutrality.

                <p>A general call for change when it comes to climate is no longer enough. Professor says a specific
                    policy push, in the housebuilding sector as much as elsewhere, is needed to make progress on
                    reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p>The call for government action is shared by Walter McLeod, creator of <a
                        href="https://carbon.substack.com/">‘Carbon Creed’</a>, a
                    newsletter
                    for people “woke” on carbon and climate. Mr. McLeod argues the transition to clean technology
                    and
                    decarbonization so far has been driven by government intervention, helped by the secondary role
                    of
                    businesses and people in adopting the policies. McLeod insists national leaders should take
                    charge,
                    but on the global stage. “Climate change is a global existential threat, a global pandemic. When
                    it
                    comes to global health issues, borders really are artificial. It’s like a healthcare bushfire.
                    The
                    same thing is true when it comes to tackling climate change as a pandemic of sorts, an
                    environmental
                    pandemic.” </p>

                <p>With behaviour being notoriously hard to change and trade-offs that will have to be made for
                    environmentally-friendly living, Professor Jones argues <b>designing for any behaviour is the
                        best
                        option, “so people don’t have to change”</b>. But while we shouldn’t expect people to make
                    drastic
                    alterations to their lifestyles, making sustainability central to our everyday actions will be
                    important. <a href="https://www.ducky.eco/">Ducky.eco</a> is a ‘climate action toolkit’ which
                    helps
                    organisations such as companies and schools set up campaigns to improve sustainable behaviour
                    amongst employees or students through gamification, information campaigns and technology. Haakon
                    Skar from Ducky.eco insists that their toolkit is only a part of the wider solution to
                    climate-neutral living,
                    mainly
                    looking
                    to raise people’s awareness of how seemingly trivial behaviours can influence people’s carbon
                    footprint.
                </p>
                <p>Instead of focussing only on recording actual consumption data, Ducky asks people
                    questions about their behaviour. “Have you saved food from being thrown out today? Have you
                    included
                    the kids in cooking today?” These are relatively easy questions to answer, says Mr. Skar,
                    insisting
                    their product does not state causation, just correlation. The basic idea for organisations to
                    subscribe to Ducky ties back to what has been dubbed the IKEA effect, says Mr. Skar, referring
                    to
                    the insight according to which consumers (users of Ducky) place a disproportionately high value
                    on
                    products (or activities, like being involved in sustainability) they partially created.

                <p>But will making people think about their actions be enough? Without imposed obligations, ‘going
                    green’ essentially remains a choice of self-interest. Mr. Skar emphasizes it’s important for
                    consumers to have a viable alternative: with a small extra cost and not difficult to use
                    compared to
                    what they’re used to. With the help of government, people will have to rethink of their ‘carbon
                    budgets’. Mr. Scales underlines people need to recognize there’s a carbon footprint associated
                    with
                    consumerism, and factor this in when looking to contribute their part to climate neutrality.
                    “You
                    have to understand what you’re doing to make your plans effectively go carbon neutral, you can’t
                    keep buying and throwing away. Buying an electric car tomorrow isn’t the best idea if your
                    current
                    car is only two years old.” In the shift from a ‘take-make-dispose’ to a doughnut economy,
                    closing
                    the cycle of raw materials consumption, government should serve as a communicator between
                    academia
                    and the wider public, funneling complicated information which is hard to digest into useful
                    recommendations, adds Mr. Skar.

                    more sustainable
                    lifestyles,
                    progress remains too slow. Part of the problem is put down to the stretched timescales of
                    national
                    and international climate progress targets, which badly reflect much needed immediate action.
                    However, <b>enacting plans for the future rather than now suits everyone</b>: governments can claim
                    to
                    tackle climate change without actually doing so, citizen’s lives remain unchanged and businesses
                    are
                    happy to talk of climate change in ‘Strategic Roadmaps’ instead of their financial statements.
                    Mr.
                    McLeod favours short-term, actionable targets: “Twenty year goals don’t make sense because
                    governments don’t work in that timeframe. Let’s set meaningful goals and execute from 2020 to
                    2030,
                    that’s about it and you’ll see things get done”.
                </p>
                <p>To ‘get things done’ is what will be needed if countries want to deliver on the promises
                    inscribed in
                    the Paris Agreement: keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above
                    pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. For that, Mr. Scales
                    says
                    the main point is how quickly we get to 95% of total carbon neutrality. <b>While climate neutrality

                        be the end goal</b>, Mr. Scales explains <b>the most important task will be the speed at which
                        we can
                        get
                        close to that level</b>. That will determine whether we can get on top of the global temperature
                    shift.

                <p>The efforts with which the EU managed to reduce 20 per cent of its (production) emissions, suggests
                    the task ahead of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 is quite daunting. In this light, it’s
                    encouraging to see Europe strengthening its political commitments to climate neutrality. Businesses
                    and citizens, however, will have to come up with initiatives of their own if they want to remain in
                    control of climate change. Either we change, or the climate will enforce its changes upon us.</p>
