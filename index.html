                        We’ve all known about climate change for a while. The UN’s intergovernmental climate change body
                        has existed for over three decades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But only in the last couple of years has the issue been thrust into the mainstream, led by Greta
                        Thunberg and her school climate strike that called for more meaningful action and inspired a
                        generation of youth activists who made the world take notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>A lot of what we read about climate change is all doom and gloom, but is there an upside? Has
                        there been any real progress? We look into climate targets in the EU; explaining what progress
                        has been made, what is hidden from emissions statistics, and where we might be headed in the
                        future.</p>

                        <p>Europe has a history of progressive environmental legislation, with the earliest measures
                            dating back to 1996, when a target was adopted to limit the global temperature rise to below
                            2 °C, compared to pre-industrial levels.

                        <p>By the end of 2020, the EU aims to cut 20% in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The EU hit this target back in 2017, when emissions were already down by 23.2%, putting them
                            ahead of schedule.

                        <p>In November 2019 a new European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, took office.
                            Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission’s first-ever female president, vowed for a green,
                            geopolitical and

                            emissions will yield no net impact on the climate: climate-damaging greenhouse gases are
                            either completely avoided, or they are offset with climate
                            protection measures (by planting trees for example).

                                        <p>As negotiations on the UK’s future relationship with the EU are currently
                                            taking place, with the transition period set to end by the end of 2020, the
                                            uncertainty regarding climate plays out across-the-board.</p>

                                        <p>George Eustice, the UK’s environment secretary, echod the Conservative’s
                                            campaign slogan to “Take back control”, when he said that : “[...] we will
                                            choose autonomy over regulatory alignment, we won’t be in the single market,
                                            we won’t be in the customs union [...]”. With Prime Minister Johnson
                                            promising “full legal autonomy” for the UK, subjecting to supervision by the
                                            EU climate bodies, with the reprimands and fines that go with it, seems
                                            unlikely.</p>

                                        <p>In March 2018, then environment secretary Michael Gove’s talked of a ‘Green
                                            Brexit’, raising visions of the UK as a global champion in green policies.
                                            With most of the UK’s environmental regulation previously covered by EU law,
                                            UK administrations will have to fill the gaps left by its departure from the
                                            continental bloc. Climate activists also fear that Brexit and the pressing
                                            discussions around trade and the Ulk’s global role, which might put the UK
                                            in a vulnerable position when it comes to agreeing on trade deals with
                                            countries with less stringent regulations as the UK’s, will push the climate
                                            crisis off the political agenda and stall the UK from taking action.</p>

                                        <p>Much hangs on how closely the UK remains aligned to Europe. To what extent
                                            will the two collaborate on environmental and climate issues? Will the UK
                                            remain a member of the EU Emissions Trading System?</p>

                                        <p>UK government officials point to domestic emission regulations which it
                                            adopted in addition to its alignment with the EU’s policies, such as the
                                            Climate Change Act of 2008 aiming to reach net-zero carbon emission by 2050
                                            from 1990 levels.</p>

                    <p>What the lifecycle of the T-shirt illustrates, is just how few greenhouse gas emissions from a
                        product, bought in the UK but produced China, are counted towards the UK emissions statistics.
                    </p>

                    <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are typically measured on the basis of production, as in the example
                        above. These are emissions that take place within a country’s national territory. Consumption
                        based-reporting, on the other hand, takes into account the effects of trade, encompassing the
                        emissions of domestic final consumption and those caused by the production of its imports. A
                        simplified formula for country A’s consumption emissions might look something like this: </p>

                    <p>CE country A = production emissions - emissions associated with exported goods + emissions
                        associated with imported goods. </p>

                    <p>An article published in the scientific journal PNAS in 2011, estimates that emissions from the
                        production of traded goods and services has increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global
                        emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%). Net emission transfers via international trade from
                        developing to developed countries increased from 0.4 Gt CO2 in 1990 to 1.6 Gt CO2 in 2008.
                        Whereas CO2 emissions in developed countries have stabilized, emissions in developing countries
                        have doubled .</p>

                    <p>With countries currently reporting their emissions on production basis, it is not hard to see why
                        this flatters statistics reported by developed regions. The chart below (“”) shows which
                        countries are net consumers according to their emissions. EU countries, represented by the bars
                        coloured in orange, look particularly heavy on consumption. This sheds a different light on the
                        emissions savings the EU has achieved so far. Although it is not possible to say whether the EU
                        would have met its 2020 emissions target if it accounted for its import-heavy status, meeting it
                        would have been harder.</p>
